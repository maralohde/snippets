# Snippets

## Shell scripts
Additional shell scripts to screen data via bash or executing single programs.

- **clean_genomes.sh:** usefull for filtering clean genomes from sourmash.
- **snippy_loop.sh:** loop for automatic snippy analysis for multiple fastas. Comparison against illumina fasta.
- **snippy_loop_for_heatmap.sh:** runs snippy for all files in ctgs and reference directory and made an .csv for heatmap plotting (ref;ctgs;SNPs)
- **snippy-multi_tab.sh:** build a .tab file from samples for snippy-multi
- **samtools_longest.contig:** get longest contig from multi-fasta file.
- **contig_count.sh:** Print number of contig of each sample.
- **ill_clean_samples.sh:** Extracting only mapped contigs.
- **ont_clean_sample.sh:** Extracting only longest contig (Chromosom)
- **make_directorys.sh:** make directorys from filenames
- **renaming_vcf.sh:** renaming files inside a directory after the directory name


## Code blocks
Useful and tested code blocks for multiple programs. Could be used for further pipelines.
